Hexagon VCARD
==========================

This project is an __experiment__ with AngularJS and SVG.

It's a digital visit card redirecting user to all websites that i'm using (Facebook, LinkedIn, Github, etc...).

## Compatibility

This project is <span style="color: red">experimental</span>.

This vcard is essentially compatible with latest browsers. I don't plan to improve the compatibility scope.

## Requirements

* Angular 1.3.x
* NodeJS (Gulp)

## License

You are free to fork it, and use it to inspire you, and create a digital vcard.
